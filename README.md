- Procedure & Functions Learning & Practice Program.pseudo

This code is written in Pseudocode from the **9618 CIE AS & A Level Computer Science** syllabus **2024**. It helps learn and practice stuff to do with procedures and functions from that syllabus. To run the code, run it with the editor in this [website](https://pseudocode.pro/editor) below. It goes in a lot of detail.

The program was featured in one of my [school's teacher's website](https://sites.google.com/gardenschool.edu.my/problem-solving9618/programming/procedures-and-functions?authuser=0)
